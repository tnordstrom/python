# Speed Typing Test
# From https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/

# Progress report: May 28 2020
# Jotted down some implementation ideas
# Installed tkinter
# Created a basic application with all the required widgets
# Ran into problems creating the About box message widget
# This file is 103 lines long right now

# Progress report: May 29 2020
# Worked on the "About" box some more, it appears just once but won't disappear yet
# Attached event on keyrelease to call new function retrieve_input
# Imported time and difflib
# Started timing the duration of typing
# Started analysis of text differences using SequenceMatcher object in difflib

# Progress report: June 1 2020
# Added calculations for error count, word count, words per minute (raw and corrected)
# First attempt at detecting end of test, has some limitations (must have entered same # of characters as the reference doc)
# Getting the results update on the GUI during, and at the end of the test
# Testing and discovering the capabilities of the difflib SequenceMatcher tool
# - It looks like it can "forget" about errors as things progress
# - It is beyond the scope of this project to "fix" this tool, or write a replacement tool, so we're going to have to live with it.
# - autojunk=False option when creating the SequenceMatcher instance seems to help suppress this behaviour
# Now Start button clears the entered text, for support of subsequent test runs
# The file is 203 lines long right now

# Progress report: June 2 2020
# Testing, making small improvements
# Fixed the removal of the About box
# I'm finding I'm running out of things to do - maybe it is time for a new project?
# It would be nice to have a better way of detecting end-of-test, but what? I can't think of a better way. Exactly matching the end of text - what if there's errors?
# The file is 228 lines long right now

Python Project Ideas: Advanced Level
31. Speed Typing Test
Letâ€™s start advanced python project ideas for beginners.
Do you remember the old typing test game which was used in Windows XP and before?
You can create a similar program that tests your typing speed.
First, you need to create a UI using a library like Tkinter.
Then create a fun typing test that displays the user speed, accuracy and words per minute in the end.
You can also find source code for the program online.

Implementation Thoughts:
Display a couple of paragraphs of plain text. Display a timer, error counter, correct keystroke counter, raw speed, accuracy, words per minute
Controls: Begin test, Stop test, Reset results? Quit Program, About, Set Difficulty (set difficulty - offer more text examples - I will leave that as a future expansion)
Hit Begin test, timing won't start until the first key is pressed
Words per minute is the standard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute 5 keystrokes, including spaces and punctuation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_typing_contest for some interesting points, and an example typing sample
https://thepracticetest.com/typing/tests/practice-paragraphs/ has some good paragraphs
User speed is the raw words per minute, not considering accuracy
Accuracy is number of correct keys - number of mistakes / number of correct keys. This might be tricky to track properly.
For example, if the typist skips a letter, this should only count as one mistake, and the algorithm should be able to resynchronize to the following letter
Another example, if the typist adds a letter, this should also only count as one mistake
So maybe there should be a concept of "next target letter" X and "subsequent target letter" Y
If the typists entry matches Y before X, this is a likely skipped letter situation and X will be updated to the letter after Y.
For simplicity of algorithm, maybe I should limit skip detection to one deep.
Consider highlighting the paragraph as it is being typed, as feedback on the typist's progress
- That's too complex, and how to display errors? Have a seperate window, one for the paragraph, the other for the typing.
sudo apt install python3-tk to install tkinker. But I can't import Tkinter into my module. What's going on here? Oh it was capitalized in the example. WhoopS!
python -m tkinter to test that it works
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
https://web.archive.org/web/20190515141525/http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/minimal-app.html
Question: is it legal to allow backspace, i.e. for the typist to correct their own mistakes on the fly? Or should backspace be disabled for this test?
For the purposes of this program, backspace (and delete) will be fully allowed, for simplicity. This also means the error rate will have to be recalculated as mistakes are corrected.
I seem to recall, in my high school typing class, that it was 5 words per mistake, and an incomplete word at the end of the test didn't count (either as a word or a mistake).
When does the test end? After a fixed time, or once all the text has been typed?

word_count = len(text_input)/5
Corrected word count =- number of errors * 5?

practice_text = "Proofreader applicants are tested primarily on their spelling, speed, and skill in finding errors in the sample text. Toward that end, they may be given a list of ten or twenty classically difficult words and a proofreading test, both tightly timed. The proofreading test will often have a maximum number of errors per quantity of text and a minimum amount of time to find them. The goal of this approach is to identify those with the best skill set."
